[00:34.03]'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
[00:38.58]And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
[00:43.01]But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength
[00:47.06]And just pull that shit out of you
[00:48.65]And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
[00:52.56]No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
[00:56.12]'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
[00:58.85]'Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
[01:02.03]'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em
[01:04.82]And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem
[01:07.64]Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?
[01:10.21]Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
[01:13.00]Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
[01:16.51]Amoxicillin's just not real enough
[01:19.02]The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
[01:21.44]A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
[01:24.59]You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
[01:27.58]Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
[01:30.37]You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
[01:32.35]Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?
[01:35.70]For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
[01:38.53]You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[01:41.14]'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
[01:43.76]'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
[01:46.59]'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
[01:49.38]I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
[01:52.10]'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
[01:54.99]'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
[01:57.66]'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
[02:00.54]I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
[02:03.29]Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
[02:06.29]When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
[02:08.83]This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
[02:11.60]Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
[02:14.46]So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
[02:17.29]And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
[02:20.17]'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
[02:23.00]I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
[02:25.74]It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
[02:28.30]Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
[02:31.31]But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
[02:34.19]So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
[02:36.91]That's why you see me walk 'round like nothing's bothering me
[02:39.72]Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
[02:42.61]You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
[02:45.03]The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me
[02:48.35]'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
[02:50.80]'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
[02:53.62]'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
[02:56.52]I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
[02:59.35]'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
[03:02.12]'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
[03:04.96]'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
[03:07.70]I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
[03:10.59]Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
[03:13.25]What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
[03:16.18]And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
[03:18.89]I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
[03:21.65]But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
[03:24.44]If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
[03:27.34]'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
[03:30.14]That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
[03:32.94]My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
[03:35.88]I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
[03:38.74]But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
[03:41.51]The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
[03:44.47]So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
[03:47.12]The track is on some battling raps who want some static?
[03:49.92]'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
[03:52.74]A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
[03:55.46]'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
[03:58.07]'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
[04:01.09]'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
[04:03.78]I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
[04:06.62]'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out
[04:09.42]'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
[04:12.18]'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
[04:15.08]I'ma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse
[04:17.40]Until the roof (until the roof)
[04:20.00]The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
[04:22.87]Until my legs (until my legs)
[04:25.43]Give out from underneath me
[04:29.26]I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
[04:36.52]Feels like no one could beat me
[04:40.28]â™ª
