[00:33.14]I'm breaking bread like a Pisces
[00:34.47]Catch me emotional; that's highly unlikely

[01:02.88]I'm on a quest, and I'm not talking dragon
[01:04.69]No, I'm not Toothless
[01:05.69]Got in the car, and she gave me her two lips
[01:07.79]Asked what she smell like, I'm telling her tulips
[01:11.33]But I'm still a zodiac killer
[01:12.83]I take her soul with a bag and a zipper
[01:14.69]I'm a Leo who eat Pisces for dinner

[01:45.02]Found out she's a Gemini now I am over that (Go)
[01:49.85]But I'm still a zodiac killer
