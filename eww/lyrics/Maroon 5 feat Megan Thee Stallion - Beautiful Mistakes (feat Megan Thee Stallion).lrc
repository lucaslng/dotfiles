[00:09.99]It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
[00:12.32]You're like a broken home to me
[00:14.88]I take a shot of memories and black out like an empty street
[00:19.53]I fill my days with the way you walk and fill my nights with broken dreams
[00:24.58]I make up lies inside my head
[00:26.75]Like, "One day, you'll come back to me"
[00:29.13]Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
[00:32.47]I'm just depressed that you're gone
[00:34.57]Not holding on, not holding on
[00:37.95]Beautiful mistakes I make inside my head
[00:42.56]She's naked in my bed
[00:44.86]And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
[00:49.85]I wouldn't take 'em back
[00:52.06]I'm in love with the past
[00:54.42]And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

[01:17.83]I fill my nights with the way you was and still wake up with broken dreams
