[00:00.17]Said you would rather die young
[00:03.45]Live for the moment, forget tomorrow
[00:06.74]Guess that you'll got it all wrong
[00:09.82]Still tryna find out which road to follow
[00:13.45]Always try to ride those paper planes
[00:16.81]Said that you were fine with my mistakes
[00:20.09]Now we're tryna call on yesterday
[00:23.66]To go back
[00:25.98]We don't always get it right
[00:28.74]Then lights go out, the music dies, no goodbye
[00:32.38]Now you're gonna realize
[00:35.32]I cast us out of paradise
[00:39.35]Even if it all went down in flames
[00:42.76]We can live to fight another day
[00:45.61]Let go and close your eyes
[00:48.15]And just remember paradise
[00:53.55](I know)
[00:56.33](Paradise)

[01:04.74]It doesn't matter tonight
[01:07.89]There's a tomorrow for you to treasure
[01:11.02]No sense in losin' our minds
[01:14.14]To keep the pieces of us together
[01:17.48]Thought about it for a while now
[01:20.35]Questioned everything up in your life now
[01:23.93]Maybe you should let it ride out
[01:26.73]And everything will come around, yeah
